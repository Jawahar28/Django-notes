# Python + Django.

# HLD (High Level Design) + LLD(Low Level Design)

# HLD (FrontEnd): It is the Bird's eye view of a system.

        It is the part that is loaded inside a web-browser on the client side, where the user sees and interacts with.

        It just shows different layers that comes together to serve a particular request without showing the actual implementation.


# LLD (Backend) : It is  used to write a code.
        It is the part that runs on a web server and is responsible for data processing, validating business roles and so on.

* Why LLD?
1. Writing Understandable code (Code should be written to understand.)
2. Writing Readable Code (Code should be written to read.)
3. Writing Reusuable Code (Code should be written to Reuse.)
4. Writing Extensible Code (Easy to add New Features.)
5. Writing Maintainable Code (Edge Cases, Test Cases, Dependency of Library)
